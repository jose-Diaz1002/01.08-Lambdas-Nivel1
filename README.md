ðŸ“š 01.08 - Lambdas - Nivel 1

ðŸ“„ Description
This project consists of a series of Java exercises designed to practice lambdas, functional interfaces, method references, 
and basic stream operations. Youâ€™ll work with lists, string manipulation, and sorting using Java 8 features.

ðŸ“Œ Exercises
âœ… Exercise 1
From a list of Strings, write a method that returns a new list containing all strings that include the letter 'o'. Print the result.

âœ… Exercise 2
Modify the method from Exercise 1 so it now returns a list of strings that:

Contain the letter 'o'

Have more than 5 characters
Print the result.

âœ… Exercise 3
Create a list containing the names of the months of the year. Print all elements of the list using a lambda expression.

âœ… Exercise 4
Repeat the same task as Exercise 3, but this time use a method reference instead of a lambda.

âœ… Exercise 5
Create a Functional Interface with a method named getPiValue() that returns a double.
From the main() method:

Instantiate the interface using a lambda expression

Assign it the value 3.1415

Invoke getPiValue() and print the result

âœ… Exercise 6
Create a list that contains both numbers and strings. Sort the list by string length from shortest to longest.

âœ… Exercise 7
Take the list from Exercise 6 and sort it in reverse order, from longest to shortest string.

âœ… Exercise 8
Create a Functional Interface with a method named reverse() that:

Accepts a String as a parameter

Returns the reversed String
From the main() method, implement the interface using a lambda expression, call the method, and print the reversed result.
